# 股票跨度问题

> 原文：<https://www.javatpoint.com/stock-span-problem>

“股票跨度问题”属于财务方面。在这个问题中，每天股价的股票跨度是确定的。它的跨度是任何给定日期前不久股票价格小于或等于该日股票价格的最大连续天数。

在给定日期之前，股票当日价格小于或等于其当日价格的最大连续天数被描述为股票当日价格的跨度 Si。

例如，如果七天价格的数组被提供为 100、80、60、70、60、75、85，则七天的跨度值为 1、1、1、2、1、4、6。

有两种方法可以解决这个库存跨度问题。这两种方法是:

*   低效方法
*   有效方法

在这个股票跨度问题中，遍历输入中的价格数组。当左侧的项目较小时，遍历左侧的元素并增加每个被访问元素的跨度值。

现在让我们借助用三种不同的编程语言 C++、Java 和 Python 编写的代码来理解 Stock span 问题。

### C++代码

让我们借助下面的 C++代码来理解这个问题。

```

// A sample C++ program to calculate stock span values  
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std;   
// Fills array S[] with span values  
void calculateSpan(int price[], int n, int S[])  
{  
    // Span value of first day is always 1  
    S[0] = 1;   
    // Calculate span value of remaining days   
    // by linearly checking previous days  
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)  
    {  
        S[i] = 1; // Initialize span value   
        // Traverse left while the next element   
        // on left is smaller than price[i]  
        for (int j = i - 1; (j >= 0) &&  
                (price[i] >= price[j]); j--)  
            S[i]++;  
    }  
}   
// A utility function to print elements of array  
void printArray(int arr[], int n)  
{  
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)  
        cout << arr[i] << " ";  
}    
// Driver code  
int main()  
{  
    int size_arr = 0;
    cout<>size_arr;
    int price[size_arr]; //= new int[size_arr];//{ 10, 4, 5, 90, 120, 80 };  
    int n = size_arr;//sizeof(price) / sizeof(price[0]);  
    int S[n];  
    int data;
    int count = 0;
      char ch;
            // Do-while loop
            // Do part for performing actions
            do
            // Menu is displayed
            // Users enter 'y' to continue 'n' if
            // entered by user , the program terminates
            {
                  // Menu
                  // Display messages
                  cout<>data;                        
                        price[count++] = data;
                        // Display message
                        cout<>ch;                 
            } while (!(ch == 'N' || ch == 'n'));
    return 0;  
}

```

在上面的 c++代码中，我们创建了一个类，该类具有查找股票插入价格的跨度值的功能。代码的流程是这样的:给用户三个选择:将股票的价格相加，计算那些插入的股票价格的跨度值，然后打印计算出的股票价格的跨度值。用户输入股票的价格；一旦成功添加价格，将调用 **calculateSpan()** 函数，该函数将计算这些插入价格值的跨度值。最后，在最后一个选项的帮助下，打印这些跨度值。

### Java 代码

让我们也借助 Java 代码来理解这个问题。

```

// A sample Java program to calculate stock span values  
import java.util.Arrays; 
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.Scanner; 
class spanStock{ 
    // A function named calSpan() is written that will be used to calculate the span of the prices of the stocks that are stored in the price array, and those calculated spans corresponding to each price is stored in the integer array S
    static void calSpan(int price[], int n, int S[]){    
        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>(); 
        st.push(0);  
        S[0] = 1;   
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){   
            while((!st.empty()) && (price[st.peek()] <= price[i])){ 
                st.pop(); 
            } 
            S[i] = (st.empty()) ? (i + 1) : (i - st.peek());

    static void display(int arr[]){

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)  
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" ");  
    } 
// Main function is written to call the calSpan() function that will be used to calculate the span of the prices of the stocks that are stored in the price array, and those calculated spans corresponding to each price is stored in the integer array S
    public static void main(String[] args){        
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the size of the span array:: \n");

                System.out.println("3\. To Display the Calculated span values.");
                int choice = scan.nextInt();
                switch (choice)
                    {
                    case 1 :

                        break;
                    case 2 :

现在我们通过这段 Python 代码找到了这个问题的解决方案。
