# 读者作家问题

> 原文：<https://www.javatpoint.com/os-readers-writers-problem>

读者-作者问题是一个经典的进程同步问题，它涉及一个数据集，比如一个文件，一次在多个进程之间共享。在这些不同的过程中，有些是 Readers——它只能读取数据集；它们不执行任何更新，有些是 Writers -可以在数据集中读写。

读取器-写入器问题用于管理各种读取器和写入器进程之间的同步，因此数据集没有问题，即不会产生不一致。

让我们用一个例子来理解——如果两个或两个以上的读者想在同一时间点访问文件，就不会有问题。然而，在其他情况下，例如当两个写入器或一个读取器和一个写入器想要在同一时间点访问文件时，可能会出现一些问题，因此任务是以这样的方式设计代码:如果一个读取器正在读取，则不允许任何写入器在同一时间点更新，类似地， 如果一个写入程序正在写入，则不允许任何读取器在该时间点读取文件，如果一个写入程序正在更新文件，则不允许其他写入程序在同一时间点更新文件。 但是，多个读取器可以同时访问该对象。

让我们通过下表了解阅读和写作的可能性:

**表 1**

| 情况 | 流程 1 | 流程 2 | 允许/不允许 |
| 案例 1 | 笔迹 | 笔迹 | 不允许 |
| 案例 2 | 阅读 | 笔迹 | 不允许 |
| 案例 3 | 笔迹 | 阅读 | 不允许 |
| 案例 4 | 阅读 | 阅读 | 允许 |

读取器和写入器的解决方案可以使用二进制信号量来实现。

我们使用两个二进制信号量“写”和“互斥”，其中二进制信号量可以定义为:

信号量:信号量是 S 中的一个整数变量，除了初始化之外，它只被两个标准的原子操作访问——等待和信号，它们的定义如下:

```

1\. wait( S )
{
while( S <= 0) ;
S--;
}

2\. signal( S )
{
S++;
}

```

从以上对等待的定义可以清楚地看出，如果 S 的值< = 0，那么它将进入一个无限循环(因为分号；while 循环之后)。而信号的作用是增加 s 的值

以下代码将提供读写器问题的解决方案，读写器流程代码如下-

### 阅读器进程代码

读者程序的代码如下-

```

static int readcount = 0;
wait (mutex);
readcount ++; // on each entry of reader increment readcount
if (readcount == 1)
{
  wait (write);
}
signal(mutex);

--READ THE FILE?

wait(mutex);
readcount --; // on every exit of reader decrement readcount
if (readcount == 0)
{
  signal (write);
}
signal(mutex);

```

在上面的 reader 代码中，**互斥体**和**写的**是**信号量**，初始值为 1，而**readcount**变量的初始值为 0。**互斥**和**写**在读写器进程代码中都是通用的，信号量**互斥**保证互斥，信号量写处理写机制。

**readcount** 变量表示同时访问文件的读者数量。时刻变量**读计数**变为 1，**等待**操作用于写入信号量，该信号量将值减少 1。这意味着不再允许写入者如何访问文件。读操作完成后，**读计数**递减 1。当**读计数**变为 0 时，用于**写**的信号操作允许写入器访问文件。

### 编写器进程代码

定义编写器进程的代码如下所示:

```

wait(write);
WRITE INTO THE FILE
signal(wrt);

```

如果一个写入器想要访问该文件，**等待**操作在**写**信号量上执行，该信号量递减**写**到 0，并且没有其他写入器可以访问该文件。当正在访问文件的写入器完成写入作业时，在**写入**时执行信号操作。

**来看看表 1** 中提到的各种情况的证明

**案例 1:** 书写-书写→不允许。那就是当两个或者两个以上的进程都愿意写的时候，那么就不允许了。让我们看看我们的代码是否在相应地工作？

```

Explanation :
The initial value of semaphore write = 1
Suppose two processes P0 and P1 wants to write, let P0 enter first the writer code, The moment P0 enters
 Wait( write ); will decrease semaphore write by one, now write = 0
And continue WRITE INTO THE FILE
Now suppose P1 wants to write at the same time (will it be allowed?) let's see.
P1 does Wait( write ), since the write value is already 0, therefore from the definition of wait, it will go into an infinite loop (i.e. Trap), hence P1 can never write anything, till P0 is writing.
Now suppose P0 has finished the task, it will
signal( write); will increase semaphore write by 1, now write = 1
if now P1 wants to write it since semaphore write > 0
This proofs that, if one process is writing, no other process is allowed to write.

```

**情况 2:** 读写→不允许。也就是说，当一个或多个进程正在读取文件时，不允许另一个进程进行写入。让我们看看我们的代码是否在相应地工作？

```

Explanation:
Initial value of semaphore mutex = 1 and variable readcount = 0
Suppose two processes P0 and P1 are in a system, P0 wants to read while P1 wants to write, P0 enter first into the reader code, the moment P0 enters 
Wait( mutex ); will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
Increment readcount by 1, now readcount = 1, next
if (readcount == 1)// evaluates to TRUE
{
  wait (write); // decrement write by 1, i.e. write = 0(which   
                   clearly proves that if one or more than one 
                   reader is reading then no writer will be  
                   allowed.
}

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 i.e. other readers are allowed to enter.

And reader continues to --READ THE FILE?

Suppose now any writer wants to enter into its code then:

As the first reader has executed wait (write); because of which write value is 0, therefore wait(writer); of the writer, code will go into an infinite loop and no writer will be allowed.
This proofs that, if one process is reading, no other process is allowed to write.
Now suppose P0 wants to stop the reading and wanted to exit then
Following sequence of instructions will take place:
wait(mutex); // decrease mutex by 1, i.e. mutex = 0
readcount --; // readcount = 0, i.e. no one is currently reading
if (readcount == 0) // evaluates TRUE
{
  signal (write); // increase write by one, i.e. write = 1 
}
signal(mutex);// increase mutex by one, i.e. mutex = 1

Now if again any writer wants to write, it can do it now, since write > 0

```

**情况 3:** 写-读→不允许。也就是说，如果一个进程正在写入文件，则不允许另一个进程读取。让我们看看我们的代码是否在相应地工作？

```

Explanation:
The initial value of semaphore write = 1
Suppose two processes P0 and P1 are in a system, P0 wants to write while P1 wants to read, P0 enter first into the writer code, The moment P0 enters 
Wait( write ); will decrease semaphore write by 1, now write = 0
And continue WRITE INTO THE FILE
Now suppose P1 wants to read the same time (will it be allowed?) let's see.
P1 enters reader's code
Initial value of semaphore mutex = 1 and variable readcount = 0
Wait( mutex ); will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
Increment readcount by 1, now readcount = 1, next
if (readcount == 1)// evaluates to TRUE
{
  wait (write); // since value of write is already 0, hence it 
                   will enter into an infinite loop and will not be  
                   allowed to proceed further (which clearly 
                   proves that if one writer is writing then no  
                   reader will be allowed.
}

The moment writer stops writing and willing to exit then 
This proofs that, if one process is writing, no other process is allowed to read.

The moment writer stops writing and willing to exit then it will execute:
signal( write); will increase semaphore write by 1, now write = 1
if now P1 wants to read it can since semaphore write > 0 

```

**案例 4:** 阅读-阅读→允许。也就是说，当一个进程正在读取文件，而其他一个或多个进程愿意读取时，那么它们都是允许的，即读-读不是互斥的。让我们看看我们的代码是否在相应地工作？

```

Explanation :
Initial value of semaphore mutex = 1 and variable readcount = 0
Suppose three processes P0, P1 and P2 are in a system, all the three processes P0, P1, and P2 want to read, let P0 enter first into the reader code, the moment P0 enters 
Wait( mutex ); will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
Increment readcount by 1, now readcount = 1, next
if (readcount == 1)// evaluates to TRUE
{
  wait (write); // decrement write by 1, i.e. write = 0(which   
                   clearly proves that if one or more than one 
                   reader is reading then no writer will be  
                   allowed.
}

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 i.e. other readers are allowed to enter.

And P0 continues to --READ THE FILE?

→Now P1 wants to enter the reader code
current value of semaphore mutex = 1 and variable readcount = 1
let P1 enter into the reader code, the moment P1 enters 
Wait( mutex ); will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
Increment readcount by 1, now readcount = 2, next
if (readcount == 1)// eval. to False, it will not enter if block

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 i.e. other readers are allowed to enter.

Now P0 and P1 continues to --READ THE FILE?

→Now P2 wants to enter the reader code
current value of semaphore mutex = 1 and variable readcount = 2
let P2 enter into the reader code, The moment P2 enters 
Wait( mutex ); will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
Increment readcount by 1, now readcount = 3, next
if (readcount == 1)// eval. to False, it will not enter if block

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 i.e. other readers are allowed to enter.

Now P0, P1, and P2 continues to --READ THE FILE?

Suppose now any writer wants to enter into its code then:

As the first reader P0 has executed wait (write); because of which write value is 0, therefore wait(writer); of the writer, code will go into an infinite loop and no writer will be allowed.  

Now suppose P0 wants to come out of system( stop reading) then
wait(mutex); //will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
readcount --; // on every exit of reader decrement readcount by 
                 one i.e. readcount = 2

if (readcount == 0)// eval. to FALSE it will not enter if block

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 i.e. other readers are allowed to exit

→ Now suppose P1 wants to come out of system (stop reading) then
wait(mutex); //will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
readcount --; // on every exit of reader decrement readcount by 
                 one i.e. readcount = 1

if (readcount == 0)// eval. to FALSE it will not enter if block

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 i.e. other readers are allowed to exit

→Now suppose P2 (last process) wants to come out of system (stop reading) then
wait(mutex); //will decrease semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 0
readcount --; // on every exit of reader decrement readcount by 
                 one i.e. readcount = 0

if (readcount == 0)// eval. to TRUE it will enter into if block
{
  signal (write); // will increment semaphore write by one, i.e. 
                     now write = 1, since P2 was the last process
                     which was reading, since now it is going out, 
                     so by making write = 1 it is allowing the writer    
                     to write now.
}

signal(mutex); // will increase semaphore mutex by 1, now mutex = 1 

The above explanation proves that if one or more than one processes are willing to read simultaneously then they are allowed.
