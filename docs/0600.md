# 二叉树的最大宽度

二叉树的最大宽度可以定义为二叉树的特定级别中存在的二叉树节点的最大数量。为了计算二叉树的最大宽度，我们需要遍历树的级别，并找到在特定级别存在的最大节点数。

让我们看一个例子来更好地理解二叉树最大宽度的概念。

![Maximum Width of a Binary Tree](../Images/8030eff8898da09261e7b4906cea1bc5.png)

在上面显示的二叉树中，根节点的值为 42，并且有它的左子树和右子树。在本例中，让我们计算每个二叉树级别中存在的节点数。上面显示的二叉树有从 0 级到 4 级的级别(有五个级别)。

*   在所示二叉树的 0 级中只有一个根节点，因此 0 级中的节点数为 1。
*   在二叉树的级别 1 中，根节点的两个子节点(右子节点和左子节点)分别具有值 29 和 89，因此二叉树的级别 1 具有两个节点。
*   二叉树的二级有三个节点(左子树根的两个子节点和右子树根的一个右子节点)，所以二叉树的二级有三个节点。
*   在二叉树的第三级中，我们有两个值为 99 的子节点。
*   在最后一层，即二叉树的第 4 层，存在两个节点。

所以，每一层的节点数是:

级别 0: 1 节点

第 1 级:2 个节点

级别 2: 3 节点

第 3 级:2 个节点

第 4 级:2 个节点。

因此，级别 2 的最大节点数为 3，三个节点的值分别为 1、35 和 99。由于级别 2 有 3 个节点，因此上面图像中显示的二叉树的最大宽度为 3。

一直以来，最深的层次不一定要有树的最大节点数，三个，二叉树的最大宽度就在那里。就像上面显示的二叉树一样，级别 2，它不是二叉树的最深级别，具有最大的节点数(3 个节点)。

### C++代码

让我们写一个 C++代码来更好地理解二叉树的最大宽度。

```

// A queue-based C++ program to create a binary tree and find the maximum width 
// of the created Binary Tree 

// stdc++ header file is included to use object of ostream and istream named cout and cin respectively to display and print data on the console
#include using namespace std ; 

/* A binary tree node has data, a pointer to the left child 
   and a pointer to right child */
struct Node 
{ 

    // a variable named data of integer type is created that will hold the data that is present in that particular node of the complete binary tree
    int data ; 

    // two variables named right and left of the node type are created that will be used to hold the addresses of the right child node and the left child node of a parent node present on the complete binary tree
    struct Node * left ; 
    struct Node * right ; 
};//end of the struct Node 

// A Function named maxWidth is written to find the maximum width of the binary tree using level order traversal 
// And for the level order traversal of the binary tree, the data structure that is used is a queue

// The maxWidth() Function will traverse through the binary tree in level order and will keep on adding each node of the binary tree that is traversed into an object of the queue data structure
// The process of adding elements in the queue data structure is repeated until the maximum width of the binary tree is found 
// There is one parameter to the maxWidth() function of struct Node type named root that will represent the root node of the binary tree whose maximum width we need to find 
// The return type of the maxWidth() function is of Integer type that will represent the maximum width of the binary tree
int maxWidth(struct Node * root) 
{ 
    // First if root is NULL (that means there are no child nodes of the root node) is checked if true then zero value is returned
    if (root == NULL) 
        return 0; 

    // The result variable of the int type is initialised with zero
    int result = 0; 

    // The level order traversal of the binary tree begins, and the count of the number of nodes in each level of the tree is kept
    // and in the last, the maximum number of nodes in a particular level will represent the maximum width of the binary tree  

    // An object of the queue data structure named q is created to store the nodes of the binary tree
    queue <node>q; 
    q.push(root); 
    while (!q.empty()) 
    { 
        // Get the size of queue when the level order 
        // traversal for one level finishes 
        int count = q.size() ; 

        // Update the maximum node count value 
        result = max(count, result); 

        // Iterate for all the nodes in the queue currently 
        while (count--) 
        { 
            // Dequeue an node from queue 
            Node *temp = q.front(); 
            q.pop(); 

            // Enqueue left and right children of 
            // dequeued node 
            if (temp->left != NULL) 
                q.push(temp->left); 
            if (temp->right != NULL) 
                q.push(temp->right); 
        } 
    } 

    // in the end, the result variable is returned as the maximum width of the binary tree  
    return result; 
} 

/* A function named newNode that allocates a new node with the given data and NULL left and right pointers. */
// There is one parameter to the newNode function of integer type that will represent the data that a particular node is storing in it
struct Node * newNode(int data) 
{ 
    struct Node * node = new Node; 
    node->data = data; 
    node->left = node->right = NULL; 
    return (node); 
} 

//The main function is written to create a binary tree and find the maximum width of the binary tree
int main() 
{

  /* Construct the tree shown below in the comments
               10
             /   \

             /   \
            70     80
    */

    // An object named root of the struct named Node is created that will act as a root node of the tree having value 10 
    struct Node *root = newNode(10);

    // add left and right child nodes to the root node of the tree having values 20 and 30 respectively
    root->left = newNode(20);
    root->right = newNode(30);

    // add left child node to the left node of the root node of the tree having value 40
    root->left->left = newNode(40);

    // add left and right child nodes to the right node of the root node of the tree having values 50 and 60 respectively
    root->right->left = newNode(50);
    root->right->right = newNode(60);

    // add left and right child nodes to the left node of the right node of the root node of the tree having values 70 and 80 respectively
    root->right->left->left = newNode(70);
    root->right->left->right = newNode(80);

    // * Once the tree is created and all the nodes of the tree are assigned their values, the maxWidth function is called to calculate the maximum width of the binary tree
    // * the root of the tree is passed as a parameter to the inorder function

    cout << "The Maximum width of the binary tree  is ";
    cout << maxWidth(root);
    cout << endl; 
    return 0; 
} // end of main fucntions</node> 
```

**输出:**运行上面的代码，它给出如下输出。

```
The Maximum width of the binary tree is 3.

```
