# 链表中的旋转操作

> 原文：<https://www.javatpoint.com/rotate-operation-in-linked-list>

有很多操作可以在链表上执行，比如插入操作，我们可以在已经存在的链表中添加一个新节点，删除操作，我们可以从链表中删除一个节点，以及显示链表所有节点中存在的数据。

在单链表中，单链表的节点指向存储下一个节点的存储单元的地址。类似地，以这种方式，所有节点都存储它们各自的下一个节点的地址。除了最后一个节点，最后一个节点的指针中的地址为空，表示它是链表的最后一个节点。

链表支持的还有一个操作，即 ***旋转操作*** 。在此操作中，链表的头节点被移动到链表的最后一个元素，链表的第一个元素成为链表中的最后一个元素。

## c 代码

现在让我们看看不同编程语言中旋转或反转链表的代码。

```

// A sample C program to rotate a given linked list 

// stdio library is included to use the input output functionalities in the program
#include #include <stdlib.h>// a struct named node is defined that will represent the node of the Singly Linked List
// the struct object has two variables in it named data and next
struct Node {
	// the data variable is of integer type and will be used to store the value associated with that particular node of the Singly Linked List
	int data;
	// the next variable is of struct node* type and will be used to store the address of the next node of the Singly Linked List
	struct Node* next;
};// end of struct node

// A function named rotate is written that will rotate the linked list in a counterclockwise direction and update the head of the Linked List. It doesn't modify the list if k is greater than or equal to the size
// So the function named rotate having two parameters named head_ref and k will represent the head node of the Linked List and k representing the number of nodes of the Linked List
// The head_ref variable is of struct Node* type and an integer variable named k
void rotate(struct Node** head_ref, int k)
{

	// first of all we have to check the value of integer variable named k, if it is zero then we need not proceed further we can simply stop the rotate operation 
	if (k == 0)
		return;

	// Let us understand the code written below for example k = 4 and
	// list = 25->30->35->40->45->50.
	struct Node* current = *head_ref;

	// current will either point to kth or NULL after this loop.
	// current will point to node 40 in the above example
	int count = 1;
	while (count < k && current != NULL) {

	}

	// If current is NULL, k is greater than or equal to count
	// of nodes in the linked list. Don't change the list in this case
	if (current == NULL)

	// current points to kth node. Store it in a variable.
	// kthNode points to node 40 in the above example
	struct Node* kthNode = current;

	// current will point to last node after this loop
	// current will point to node 60 in the above example
	while (current->next != NULL)

	// Change next of last node to previous head
	// Next of 60 is now changed to node 10
	current->next = *head_ref;

	// Change head to (k+1)th node

	*head_ref = kthNode->next;

	// change next of kth node to NULL
	// next of 40 is now NULL
	kthNode->next = NULL;
}//end of the rotate function

// A function named push is written to add a new node to the Linked List

	// Once the already existing Linked List is appended with the new node now the head pointer is moved to the new node making the new node the head node of the Linked List
	(*head_ref) = new_node;
} // end of the push function

// A function named printList is written to print the data in the nodes of the Singly Linked List
